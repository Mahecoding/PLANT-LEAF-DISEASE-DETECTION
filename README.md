**Abstract**
Plants are the primary source of food for the whole population. This work included 3 models namely plant disease prediction, hybrid crop recommendation, fertilizer recommendation. 

The  objective of this proposed work is to detect plant diseases of the tomato leaf of 10 classes and also 13 different crops of 38 classes using machine learning algorithms and provide correct amount of fertilizers to the affected plant and recommend the crop based on soil in the city and state.

 On prediction, disease prediction model gives the crop name and disease, cause of disease, how to prevent or cure the disease. 
  
**OBJECTIVE** 

The main objective of proposed system is to design such system to detect the plant leaf disease accurately and efficiently identity and classify disease or abnormalities in plant based on images or visual data and to provide remedy for the disease that is detected.

And also identify type of  the disease of  plants and suggesting the name of pesticides to be used and recommending the most effective and appropriate strategies for disease management.

Providing advice on fertilizer which is based on soil and also giving suggestions regarding the recommendation of fertilizer to prevents farmers from applying an excessive amount of fertilizers and minimizing the related environmental damages and maximizing their productivity and profitability while considering sustainability and environmental factors.

The objective of crop recommendation is to provide farmers with actionable crops advice based on the soil test result from the user input.
